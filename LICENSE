## 🎉 WHAT YOU CAN DO (Literally Everything) 🚀

Permission is hereby granted, **FREE OF CHARGE** 💰🆓 (yes, ZERO dollars, ZILCH, NADA, not even a penny 🪙), to **ANY PERSON** 👤👥👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 (that's you, your dog 🐕, your cat 🐈, your AI assistant 🤖, literally anyone) obtaining a copy of this absolutely MAGNIFICENT software 💎 and its associated documentation files 📚 (hereinafter referred to as "The Software" - because we're fancy like that 🎩):

### ✅ YOU MAY:

- **USE** it 🖥️💻📱 (on your laptop, your phone, your smart fridge, your Tesla, WHEREVER)
- **COPY** it 📋🖨️ (make a million copies, print it out and wallpaper your bathroom, go wild)
- **MODIFY** it 🔧⚙️🛠️ (change literally everything, make it worse, make it better, make it sing opera 🎵)
- **MERGE** it 🔀 (mash it together with other code like you're making a coding smoothie 🥤)
- **PUBLISH** it 📢📡 (tell the world, scream it from the rooftops 🏢, skywrite it ✈️)
- **DISTRIBUTE** it 📦🚚 (give it to your friends, your enemies, random strangers on the internet 🌐)
- **SUBLICENSE** it 📃 (put it under ANOTHER license because inception is cool 🎬)
- **SELL** it 💵💸 (yes, you can LITERALLY SELL THIS FREE SOFTWARE - capitalism baby! 📈)

### 🎁 EVEN BETTER:

You can **PERMIT OTHERS** to do ALL OF THE ABOVE! 🙌 That's right, you can give OTHER people permission to do whatever they want! It's permissions all the way down! 🐢🐢🐢

## ⚠️ THE BORING LEGAL STUFF (But Important!) 📋

### 📌 Condition #1: Give Credit Where Credit Is Due

The above copyright notice ☝️ (that's the part where it says "Copyright (c) 2025 Jonathan Edwards") and this permission notice (yes, this ENTIRE ridiculous document 📄) **SHALL BE INCLUDED** in:

- ALL copies 📚📚📚 (every single one)
- OR substantial portions 📖 (like, most of it)

Of the Software. **DO NOT FORGET THIS** or the license police 👮‍♂️🚨 will... actually, nothing will happen because there are no license police, but still, it's the right thing to do! 😇

## 🚫 THE "COVER YOUR ASS" CLAUSE 🍑🛡️

### ⚡ ZERO WARRANTIES! NONE! NADA! ZILCH! 🚫🔥

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED **"AS IS"** 📦 (which is lawyer-speak for "what you see is what you get, buddy 🤷‍♂️"):

**WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND** - and we mean **ANY KIND**: 🎪

- ❌ NOT **EXPRESS** warranties (the kind we tell you about)
- ❌ NOT **IMPLIED** warranties (the kind lawyers made up to sue people)
- ❌ NOT warranties of **MERCHANTABILITY** 🏪 (won't promise it's sellable)
- ❌ NOT warranties of **FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE** 🎯 (won't promise it works for your thing)
- ❌ NOT warranties of **NONINFRINGEMENT** ⚖️ (won't promise we didn't accidentally copy someone)
- ❌ NOT **ANY OTHER KIND OF WARRANTY** you can possibly imagine 🌈🦄

### 🙅‍♂️ WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR LITERALLY ANYTHING 💥

**IN NO EVENT** 📅🚫 (that's NEVER, as in NOT EVER, as in ABSOLUTELY NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES 🙅‍♀️🙅‍♂️) shall the **AUTHORS** ✍️ or **COPYRIGHT HOLDERS** 👨‍⚖️ be liable for:

- **ANY CLAIM** 📢 (someone saying we owe them something)
- **DAMAGES** 💔 (broken stuff, sad feelings, lost money 💸)
- **OTHER LIABILITY** ⚡ (anything else that could possibly go wrong)

This includes but is ABSOLUTELY NOT LIMITED TO 🚀:

- 💥 Your computer exploding
- 🔥 Your server catching fire
- 😱 Existential dread from reading bad code
- 🐛 Bugs that achieve sentience
- ⏰ Time travel paradoxes from your CI/CD pipeline
- 👽 Alien invasions caused by your API endpoints
- 🌊 Floods, famines, pestilence (probably not our fault but we're covering bases)
- 📉 Stock market crashes triggered by your JavaScript
- 🤖 Robot uprisings (seriously, not our problem)
- ☕ Spilled coffee on your keyboard (you should've used a lid)

### 🤝 Whether These Disasters Arise From:

- **CONTRACT** 📝 (fancy written agreement)
- **TORT** ⚖️ (fancy lawyer word for "you wronged me")
- **OR OTHERWISE** 🤷 (literally any other possible way something can go wrong)

### 🎯 Even If:

- We were **ADVISED** 💭 of the possibility of such damage (someone literally told us this could happen)
- We **KNEW** 🧠 it would happen (we saw it coming a mile away)
- We **CAUSED** it intentionally 😈 (just kidding, we didn't, but legally we're covering this too)

### 🔗 Whether It's Connected To:

- **ARISING FROM** 🌱 (grows out of)
- **OUT OF** 🚪 (comes from)
- **IN CONNECTION WITH** 🔗 (somehow related to)

The Software **OR** ⚡ the **USE** 🖥️ or **OTHER DEALINGS** 🤹 in the Software.

## 🎊 TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read) 📝

### ✅ You Can:
Do **LITERALLY ANYTHING** you want with this code! 🎉🚀🌟

### ⚠️ But:
Don't forget to include this license! 📄✨

### 🚫 And:
If it breaks, catches fire 🔥, becomes sentient 🤖, or causes the apocalypse 💀... **NOT OUR PROBLEM!** 🤷‍♂️🙃

## 🎤 Final Words of Wisdom 💡

This license is more permissive than your parents on prom night. 🕺💃
Go forth and code! 💻✨
Break things! 💥
Build amazing stuff! 🏗️
Just don't blame us when it all goes sideways! 🎢

**Legal Translation:** This is actually a real MIT License. It's just... more fun. 😎 The emoji version is legally equivalent to the boring version, except it's way cooler and you actually read it. You're welcome. 🎁
